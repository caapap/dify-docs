title: Human in the Loop
---

## Introduction

The Human in the Loop (HITL) node pauses <Tooltip tip="Both Workflows and Chatflows are types of workflows.">your workflow</Tooltip> at critical points to collect human input, review, or decisions before execution continues.

When the workflow reaches this node, it generates a customizable interface that can be delivered through multiple channels (web app, email, Slack, etc.). Through this interface, a person can review data, provide input, and choose from predefined actions (like `Approve` or `Regenerate`) that determine how the workflow proceeds.

Think of it as a *pause* button that solves a fundamental challenge: pure automation sacrifices quality control, while pure manual processes sacrifice efficiency. By embedding human judgment directly where it matters, you can **balance automated efficiency with human oversight**.

Here's how the HITL node can strengthen your Dify apps:

- **Enhance Quality Control**: Add a human review layer for AI-generated outputs before they are published or sent.
    > Example: Let a content editor review and approve AI-generated blog posts before they are automatically published.

- **Improve Flexibility**: Handle unexpected situations by letting users supply missing details or make corrections mid-workflow.
    > Example: In a support automation flow, request extra information from a user when ticket data is incomplete.

- **Streamline Collaboration**: Bring non-technical members (such as editors, managers, or support staff) directly into workflows without complex integrations.
    > Example: A project manager receives a quick Slack prompt to review and approve an AI-generated update.

## Configure an HITL Node

To make an HITL node work properly, you need to configure the following:

- **Delivery method**: How the task reaches whom

- **Form content**: What information users see and edit

- **User action**: What actions users can take & how the workflow should respond accordingly

- **Timeout strategy**: What happens if no human response is received in time

### Delivery Method

Built-in web app / email support

Enable, delete, configure, debug / test

<Tip>
    To learn about testing available delivery methods, see [Test an HITL Node](#test-an-hitl-node).

### Timeout Strategy

To prevent your workflow from getting stuck infinitely waiting for a response, you need to define a timeout strategy so it can resume automatically by following a fallback path if no recipients act.

- **Timeout period**: How long the workflow should wait (in hours or days) before timing out.

- **Timeout path**: The fallback branch the workflow follows when no user responds within the set timeout period. It can lead to a notification or an automatic decision.

## Best Practices

- Combine HITL with IF/ELSE nodes to build conditional logic for dynamic decision-making.
