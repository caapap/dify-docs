## Introduction

The Human Input node pauses your <Tooltip tip="Both Workflows and Chatflows are types of workflows.">workflow</Tooltip> at critical points to collect human input, review, or decisions before execution continues.

![Human in the Loop Node]()

When the workflow reaches this node, it generates a customizable interface that can be delivered through multiple channels (e.g., web app or email). Through this interface, a person can review data, provide input, and choose from predefined actions (like `Approve` or `Regenerate`) that determine how the workflow proceeds.

Think of it as a *pause* button that solves a core challenge: pure automation sacrifices quality control, while pure manual processes sacrifice efficiency. By embedding human judgment directly where it matters, you can **balance automated efficiency with human oversight**.

Here's how the Human Input node can strengthen your AI apps:

- **Enhance Quality Control**: Add a human review step for AI-generated outputs before they are published or sent.
    > Example: A content editor reviews and refines AI-drafted blog posts before they go live.

- **Increase Trust & Safety**: Require manual approval for critical actions in high-stakes processes.
    > Example: A compliance officer must approve financial reports before they're automatically delivered to clients.

- **Improve Flexibility**: Handle unexpected situations by letting users supply missing details or make corrections mid-workflow.
    > Example: In a support automation flow, request extra information from a user when ticket data is incomplete.

- **Streamline Collaboration**: Bring non-technical collaborators (such as editors, managers, or support staff) directly into workflows without complex integrations.
    > Example: Project managers receive a review request directly in their email inbox and respond without switching platforms or logging into other systems.

## Configure a Human Input Node

To make a Human Input node work properly, configure the following:

- **Delivery method**: How the human input request is sent to users.

- **Form content**: What information users see and edit.

- **User action**: What actions users can take and how the workflow responds accordingly.

- **Timeout strategy**: What happens if no user responds within a set time.

<Tip>
    After configuration, click **Preview** to see how the request page will appear to users.
</Tip>

### Delivery Method

Choose the channel through which the human input request reaches users. Two delivery options are currently available:

- **Web app**: Generates a shareable link to a web page where the user can review, provide input, and take action. This link is available as the `Request URL` variable that can be referenced elsewhere in the workflow.

- **Email**: Sends an email containing the request directly to one or more recipients.

    <Note>
        Make sure to include the `Request URL` variable in the email body so recipients can access the request page.
    </Note>

### Form Content

Customize the content displayed on the request page that users will read, review, and edit. You can:

- Format and structure the content using **Markdown** syntax

- Reference workflow **variables** to display dynamic data

- Add interactive **input fields** for users to provide information or make edits

    <Info>
        - Input fields can be pre-filled with either a dynamic variable or static content.

        - Each input field becomes an output variable that can be used in downstream nodes.
    </Info>

### User Actions

Define the decision buttons (e.g., `Approve`, `Regenerate`, `Post`, or `Share`) that users can click when reviewing a human input request. 

Each button creates a corresponding branch from the Human Input node, routing the execution path based on the user's choice. 

For example, an `Approve` branch might lead to nodes that trigger content publishing, while a `Regenerate` branch might loop back to an AI node to revise the output.

<Tip>
    Customize the button style using available presets to visually distinguish actions and convey their importance. For example, use a prominent style for key actions like `Approve` and a subtler one for secondary options.
</Tip>

### Timeout Strategy

Set a timeout strategy to determine how the workflow proceeds when no users act within a given period. This ensures your workflow continues automatically instead of stalling indefinitely.

- **Timeout period**: How long the workflow should wait (in hours or days) before timing out.

- **Timeout path**: The fallback branch the workflow follows when no user responds within the set timeout period. It can lead to a notification or an automatic decision.

## Best Practices

- Combine the Human Input node with IF/ELSE nodes to build conditional logic for dynamic decision-making.
